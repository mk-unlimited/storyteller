Social speeches can be any speech given at a social occasion or event. They are personalized to those being honored or recognized and are usually shorter than 
informative or persuasive speeches. Depending on the occasion, often the purpose of a social speech is to remember, praise, or celebrate.

There are a few types of social speeches, there is the toast , the acceptance speech and a speech praising an individual or a group and finally the eulogy(




## Types of social speeches


When composing your toast, create a speech that fits the occasion in both mood and language. For formal gatherings, a good toast is dignified, although some humor may be appropriate.
For informal occasions where guests are likely to be acquainted with one another, toasts can be lighter in tone and phrased to fit the relaxed atmosphere. It is generally best to avoid 
clich√©s, as they may be perceived as insincere or shallow.




Here are some rules that I personally follow when crafting a toast:


1. Keep it short and simple.
2. Do not use over used ideas, find something unique to that person.
3. Do not use any cliches or topics that have been used too many times.
4. Keep it to about 4 to 5 minutes.
5. If there is too many people to mention, keep the rest in one sentence.

## Extra points to leave with

There are some people who would tell not to give any humor or it isnt necessary and stick with the appraisals. The key here is to always recognize your audience, gauge whether
they would be able to take your humor. Find the common humor that their whole family shares and also make sure it's not too embarrasing. This comes down to culture and 
the type of people your dealing with and only you would be able to tell if this is right or not. Afterall, they trust you to give a speech on their most important day of their lifes.


Here is a video example for a wedding toast on how this may work for you.
