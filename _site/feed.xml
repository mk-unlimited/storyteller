<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>I bring you to a story where I was actually talking to a former CID special branch officer who was in service during the communist siege on malaysian land. He gave me a slight picture into what it was like during that meancing peroid. Cause everyone was attacking everyone. You could not even walk out on the streets like you were today.</p>

<p>It was during that conversation he told me something that I learnt about negotiation. He mentioned that the most important thing is that a negotiation between 2 parties or more is to ensure the other side understands the perspective of the opponent and vice versa. Whether it’s emotional or logical, best be both I would say. Now this is where I came to understand the foundations on negotiation.</p>

<p>Fellow readers today I will introduce 3 points which i’ve used personally and which I know will be your swiss knife in any situation.</p>

<h1 id="knowing-how-to-deliver-empathy">Knowing how to deliver empathy</h1>

<p>Yes empathy is important, I think most people know that when it comes negotiating. The truth is the right kind of empathy is needed in order to to have a real conversation around that subject matter. The first step to that, is by listening and observing the other person.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mention the story about doctor and sales person, and how the sales person saw how he spoke about his patients and saw how he treated them and mentioned. I noticed you care alot about your patients well being. Doctor immediately changed from annoyed to happy.</code></p>

<p>Listening and observing gives the signal to the other person that your able to understand his view and builds great trust. If you actually realize the person starts opening up more and the conversation starts rolling. It all begins with listening and observing first.</p>

<h1 id="asking-the-right-open-ended-question">Asking the right open ended question</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fprodimages.6seconds.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F03%2F14224907%2Fempathy-what-they-feel.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="empathy" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What is an open ended question and why do is it important. Open ended questions gives you an insight to what the other person is feeling or thinking and it also allows you to extend a meaningful conversation with the other person. This works in negotiating your way in to a topic or out of one.</p>

<p>So if I ask An Gee, “An Gee is there a special someone in your life ?”. She will reply either yes or no. If i structed it as such that. “An Gee, how is the dating scene working out for you ?”. She will reply how she met a guy, how was the experience and so forth.</p>

<p>This are some things you could use to discover more about the other person and figure out their priorities in life. After all, they’re spending  their precious time and energy with you, surely it must be something important to them.</p>

<p>Just make sure not to ask too many of them and answer a few. Its not and interigation, its a negotiation. 2 parties need to be involved.</p>

<h1 id="geting-the-influencer">Geting the Influencer</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/thmb/11n8h2EK5nWNMCY8EHIXhnQmzXg=/1480x987/filters:fill(auto,1)/GettyImages-mentorrelationship-5734a7983df78c6bb0c06aba.jpg" alt="influencer" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Now most times this is very important, not always what you say will be taken into consideration. The other person might be just too stubborn. The key here is to find the influencer to that person. It is best to find out who the influencer is first before you approach that person or lead to that influencer. This is best summarized in an experienced I had with a female friend of mine.</p>

<p>“A beggar walked to us while we were walking . They know that when you see a boy and girl walking from a far assuming they’re couples are the best way to get the most money out them. So this beggar approached me, asking for money while looking simultanously to the girl.</p>

<p>And the girl looked at me, and I looked at the beggar. And just like that she money out of me.  Boom</p>

<p>Now we see what happen and who was the influencer that allowed the beggar to negotiate in. The girl right. Not to say im stubborn with giving money, it just happened to be more convincing.</p>

<h1 id="conlusion">Conlusion</h1>

<p>To conclude delivering empathy, the right open ended question and getting hold of the influencer is needed when your try to negotiate. Truth be told that these 3 points could be used to actually negotiate your way in and out of anything.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with something extra today that you could actually try it out. Use the cause technique.</p>]]></content><author><name>Speech Crafter</name></author><category term="Negotiation" /><category term="Speech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Negotiation is kinda everywhere if you think about it carefully.
